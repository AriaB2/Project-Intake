# Project-Intake

Client: Instructors of Senior Design

User:  Clients, Instructors, and Students

The Need: 
A platform that allow clients to propose project ideas, allow faculty members to accept the project as a possible project, and to allow students to engage in the project.

The Problem: 
There is a myriad of projects that individuals want developed. These projects, however, are not well know to Instructors and Students.

Solution: 
A website that acts as a clearinghouse of proposed projects, allows projects to be selected, and then serves publicize the work of the students.
